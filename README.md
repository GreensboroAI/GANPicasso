# GANPicasso
The idea behind this project is to create a GAN in Keras that will generate artwork

# What we are using as base
I believe that https://github.com/ctmakro/hellotensor/blob/master/lets_gan_clean.py will be the best base to start with for this project.

# What we need to do for our model
We need to build a function to take our own images from a directory and get them ready for input in to this model. This model uses cifar and the load_data() function from that package to get the imgages for the model. 

# Other items
Will likely need to troublshoot various small bugs as we have input our own image data.
